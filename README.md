## ArrayToAdd.cs
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?  I think I did, what do you think..... O(n)?

Coded in 5 minutes, using test driven development, i.e. wrote failing test first.  :-)
