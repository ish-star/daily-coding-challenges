A set of daily coding challenges and unit tests, challenges provided by www.dailycodingproblems.com, THANKS!!

## ArrayToAdd.cs
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?  I think I did, what do you think..... O(n)?

Coded in 5 minutes, using test driven development, i.e. wrote failing test first.  :-)

## MultiplyArray.cs
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?  Loop within a loop, of course, is a way to brute force it.... :-/

## MoneySpent*.cs
A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a give budget. Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items, return .

For example: if your input was a budget of 60, a list of keyboards with prices [40,50,60], and drives [5,8,12], then the most expensive combination a person can spend is 58.
